## Monicount – AI Finances Application

Monicount is a minimalist personal finance web app designed for people with **variable income**, especially **neurodivergent and chronically ill users** who live with fatigue and executive dysfunction.  
Instead of overwhelming dashboards, Monicount focuses on low-cognitive-load budgeting: clear categories, calm visuals and gentle, AI-powered summaries.

Users can:
- Organise income and expenses into meaningful categories (Essentials, Lifestyle, Investments / Goals)
- Compare **planned vs actual** spending over time
- Track credit cards and recurring payments
- Receive AI-generated insights and optimisation tips in natural language
